Here's a README for the GitHub project of the SessionBox-like Edge Extension:



 SessionBox for Edge Extension

SessionBox for Edge is an extension designed to allow users to manage multiple online accounts in a single browser window. It enables session isolation, synchronization across devices, and helps maintain privacy and security when using multiple accounts on the same website simultaneously.

This extension is built for Microsoft Edge and uses WebExtension APIs to create isolated browsing environments, making it easy to log in to multiple accounts without conflicts.



 Features

- Multi-Account Management: Allows users to manage multiple accounts on the same website at the same time.
- Session Isolation: Isolates browser sessions across different tabs, preventing account data from mixing.
- Session Organization: Users can organize sessions into groups to keep things tidy and easily accessible.
- Session Synchronization: Syncs sessions across multiple devices using Edge’s `chrome.storage.sync` API.
- Anti-Detection Features: Includes features for fingerprint masking to avoid detection by websites.
- Save & Restore Sessions: Save the current browser window and restore it later, preserving the session states and open tabs.
- Cross-Device Access: Access your saved sessions from any device running the extension.



 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SessionBox-Edge-Extension.git
   cd SessionBox-Edge-Extension
   ```
  

3. Load the extension in Edge:

   1. Open Edge and go to `edge://extensions/`.
   2. Enable Developer Mode at the bottom.
   3. Click Load unpacked.
   4. Select the project folder.



 How to Use

1. Managing Multiple Accounts:
   - Open multiple tabs and log in to different accounts of the same website.
   - Each account operates in its own isolated environment, preventing conflicts between sessions.

2. Saving and Restoring Sessions:
   - Click the extension icon in the toolbar to open the popup.
   - Use the Save Current Window button to save the session state (tabs and accounts).
   - Use the Restore Last Window button to restore your previously saved sessions.

3. Clearing Sessions:
   - Click the Clear All Sessions button to remove all saved sessions.

4. Syncing Across Devices:
   - Your session data is stored using Edge’s `chrome.storage.sync` API, which allows synchronization across devices. Ensure the extension is installed and logged into the same Edge profile on all devices to sync your sessions.



 Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML & CSS (for popup UI)
- WebExtension API (for session management and cross-tab communication)
- Edge API (for session storage and synchronization)



 Development

To start contributing or working on the extension locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SessionBox-Edge-Extension.git
   ``` 

2. Install dependencies (if any, for future improvements):

   - If you are using build tools (e.g., Webpack or Babel), run the necessary setup steps to install dependencies.

3. Run locally by loading the unpacked extension in Edge:

   - Open Edge and navigate to `edge://extensions/`.
   - Enable Developer Mode and click Load unpacked.
   - Select the folder containing your local extension files.



 Future Features

- Advanced Anti-Detect Features: Implementing more advanced techniques for masking digital fingerprints.
- Custom Session Profiles: Allow users to create custom profiles for different use cases (e.g., work, personal, social media).
- Advanced Session Sync: Enable more detailed control over session synchronization (e.g., syncing specific sessions between devices).
